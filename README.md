================

A non-todo-list comparison of javascript MVC libraries using Google Maps and Google Places.

Not Another Todo List
---------------------

Know all those comparisons of javascript MVC\* frameworks using todo lists?
This is not one of them. This time we'll be doing something simple: searching
for venues with Google Maps and Google Places. It's a good way to examine the
code for the different libraries and decide which one you're most comfortable
with.

\* _Yes, Knockout.js is MVVM, not MVC. Still, close enough._
